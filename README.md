# README

Welcome to my humble RoR project, the motivation behind this site is an attempt
to practice my skills as a software engineer, specifically with Backend and
rails, and maybe get a job in the process.

For this project I used a simple scaffolding, along with documentation and
intensive search on how to do the things I needed (a.k.a Stack overflow),
I also used the "materialize" framework, which is a novelty for me, since the
only css framework I ever used was bootstrap, I used rubocop as a code linter,
although I confess the code could be more polished.

How to run:

- Make sure you have git and rails installed and updated on your machine.
- git clone this repository
- cd into the project folder
- run $ rails db:migrate
- run $ bundle install
- run $ rails server
- open your browser on "localhost:3000"

And you should be all set!

By the way, this project isn't complete yet, there are some flaws on routing,
because it uses scaffolding, I also wasn't able to make validations (sorry,
I gotta learn jquery/ajax first) - I really don't like to copy/use code that
I don't understand.

That's it, I hope you like it, cheers!
